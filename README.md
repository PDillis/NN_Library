# NN_Library

Based on [Andrew Ng's Deep Learning course in Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning), I have decided to keep track of the functions used whilst implementing DNNs using [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), as well as new ones I have used before and plan to use in the future. The plan thus far is, as more and more functions are added, to separate them into different files to be easily found. 

If all else fails and I do not continue to mantain this collection, I will commit it to [Brendan Fortuner's ML Cheatsheet](http://ml-cheatsheet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
